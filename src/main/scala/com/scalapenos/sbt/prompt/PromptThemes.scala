   * An advanced theme that uses a combination of fancy colors and unicode separators

   * This prompt will show the following information:
   *
   *  - a handy marker to indicate you are in SBT (instead of a normal bash/zsh shell)
   *  - the current Git branch (in green for a clean working directory, in yellow for a dirty one)
   *  - the current project, including the root project of a multi-project build
   *
   * Note:
   *  This theme uses some special icon-like characters (the separator character
   *  and the Git branch icon) that are not supported by most fonts. In order
   *  for this theme to render correctly, you will need to configure your terminal
   *  with a Powerline-patched font.
   *  See https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts
   *
   * This theme is based on a customized version of the "agnoster" oh-my-zsh theme.
   * More information here:
   *  - https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874
   *  - https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme
